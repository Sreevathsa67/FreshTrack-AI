# **FreshTrack AI – Real-Time Freshness & Emissions Intelligence System**

## ✅ Overview  
FreshTrack AI is an **IoT + Edge AI + Blockchain-powered solution** designed to track the **freshness, condition, and carbon emissions** of perishable goods across Walmart’s cold chain — from **warehouse to shelf**.

Our goal:  
✔ Reduce food spoilage by **40–60%**  
✔ Optimize **last-mile delivery**  
✔ Ensure **sustainability compliance** with real-time emissions tracking  

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Every year, U.S. grocery retailers lose **$3.6 billion** due to food spoilage. Traditional monitoring systems lack real-time freshness tracking and emissions accountability, resulting in waste, financial loss, and poor ESG compliance.

---

## **Our Solution**  
FreshTrack AI provides **end-to-end monitoring** by:  
- **IoT Smart Tags**: Attach to pallets and monitor **temperature, humidity, ethylene gas, vibration, and location** in real-time.  
- **Edge AI**: Predict shelf life and spoilage risk on-device, reducing cloud dependency.  
- **Blockchain**: Immutable storage for compliance and transparency.  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Re-route trucks and prioritize unloading based on real-time freshness data.  
- **Dashboard**: Actionable insights for managers including freshness scores, spoilage alerts, and emissions metrics.

## **Core Features**  
✅ Real-time freshness tracking  
✅ Spoilage risk prediction  
✅ Carbon emissions per route  
✅ Blockchain-powered traceability  
✅ AI-driven route optimization

## **Tech Stack**  
- **IoT Devices**: ESP32, BME280 (Temp & Humidity), MiCS-5524 (Gas), ADXL345 (Vibration), NEO-6M GPS  
- **Connectivity**: MQTT / GSM (SIM800L)  
- **Edge AI**: TensorFlow Lite on ESP32 or Jetson Nano  
- **Backend**: Node.js / FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka  
- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric  
- **Frontend**: React.js / PowerBI
